# Final Snake

## what is it?
As the name suggests, it is yet another implementation of a popular Snake game. This time you are not limited to four directions when it comes to turning. The game was created with PocketGo and other retrohandhelds in mind. I hope you like it.

## contribution
- fruits and veggies by [Mr. Milkduds](https://mrmilkduds.itch.io/).

## to do
- graphics - tiled background (hearts, stars, squares, diamonds, etc.), sprites for snake and food, maybe simple animations?
- new camera mode - TPP but with momentum,
- music and sounds,
- custom level support,
- multiple snakes (one for player, others for AI),
- various behaviour of food - static, running away, wandering, tail-following, evading, growing (gives more length when eaten),
- various effects of food (maybe dependent on color) - longer, able to eat obstacles and its own tail, faster, slower,
- maybe acceleration should make snake wiggle?
