# Final Snake

## what is it?
As the name suggests, it is yet another implementation of a popular Snake game. This time you are not limited to four directions when it comes to turning. The game was created with PocketGo and other retrohandhelds in mind. I hope you like it.

## to do
- graphics,
- more detailed background (makes easier to navigate in some camera modes),
- [miyoo] fix CM_TPP bug (camera gets awkward sometimes) - probably it is a fault of buggy sin/cos implementation in CFW,
- more levels,
- menu and game over screens.
