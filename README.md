# Final Snake

## what is it?
As the name suggests, it is yet another implementation of a popular Snake game. This time you are not limited to four directions when it comes to turning. The game was created with PocketGo and other retrohandhelds in mind. I hope you like it.

## contribution
- crunch sound by Borgory from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/),
- bite, ghost, harm, onix and unlock sounds from [The Battle for Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org/),
- circular saw blades from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/),
- fruits and veggies by [Mr. Milkduds](https://mrmilkduds.itch.io/).

## to do
- music and sounds,
- custom level support,
- multiple snakes (one for player, others for AI),
- combos - eat fruits and veggies in a certain order to get additional bonuses.
